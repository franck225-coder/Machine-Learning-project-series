					    # MACHINE LEARNING (ML) SERIES # 

## Supervised learning => Classification & Regression
	- Algorithms
		- Decision tree
		- Random forest 
		- KNN
		- Logistic regression
		- Support Vector Machines

## Unsupervised learning => Clustering & Association & Dimensionality Reduction.
	- Algorithms
		- K-means clustering
		- K Nearest Neighbours

## Types of Learners in classification 
	- Lazy Learners (More time on test set & less time on train set) 
		- K-nearest neighbor
		- case based reasoning 
	- Eager Learners (More time on train set & less time on test set) 
		- Decision Trees
		- Naïve Bayes
		- ANN 
## Classification Evaluation Metrics
	- Confusion Matrix:
		{
			True Positives (TP): It is the case when both actual class & predicted class of data point is 1.
			True Negatives (TN) − It is the case when both actual class & predicted class of data point is 0.
			False Positives (FP) − It is the case when actual class of data point is 0 & predicted class of data point is 1.
			False Negatives (FN) − It is the case when actual class of data point is 1 & predicted class of data point is 0.
		}
	- Accuracy: TP + TN / TP + FP + FN + TN
	- Precision: TP / TP + FP
	- Recall: TP / TP + FN 
	- Specificity != (Recall): TN / TN + FP

## Various ML Classification Algorithms
	- Logistic Regression
	- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
	- Decision Tree
	- Naïve Bayes
	- Random Forest

## Logistic reression
	- Binary (0 or 1; True or False; Yes or No; Win ir Lose etc.)
	- Multinomial, no quantitative significance, (Type A, Type B, Type C etc.)
	- Ordinal, quantitative significance (grade A, grade E, grade B etc)
