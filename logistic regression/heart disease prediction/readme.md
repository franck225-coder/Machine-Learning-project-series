# Introduction

In this repository we implement various Machine Learning (ML) techniques applied on the *cancer dataset*
to predict wether given a patient with particular symptoms is likely to be
affected by cancer or not.
The methods implemented are listed as follows:
```
1. Linear Regression
2. K Nearest Neighbors
```
# TODO - List
