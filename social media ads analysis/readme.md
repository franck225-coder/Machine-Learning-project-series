# **Social Media ads Analysis**
In machine learning, classification refers to the process of training a model to determine which category an entry belongs to. Because there are so many classification algorithms in machine learning, demonstrating a complete comparison of classification algorithms in machine learning will be an exciting and unique computer learning project for a novice. For this work, you must first select a classification-based issue statement and identify any classification algorithms that may be applicable to your situation. Following that, you must train classification models and compare their performance. We will be working on a social media marketing dataset __(./dataset/social_media_ads.csv)__

## __1. Dataset__
The datset is composed of 3 features the __age__ of the user, 
the __EstimatedSalary__ of the user and __Purchased__ which indicates
if the user purchases the ads or not.
